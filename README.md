# Heroku buildpack: Ruby + dep + node

A buildpack to use Ruby (MRI) with node on Heroku using [dep](https://github.com/cyx/dep/) for
dependency management.

This is a fork of [heroku-buildpack-ruby-alt](https://github.com/guilleiguaran/heroku-buildpack-ruby-alt) that adds node to the system.

## Usage

Just create a Heroku app like this:

    heroku create --buildpack https://github.com/dcadenas/heroku-buildpack-ruby-alt2

## Customization

This uses the last stable version of Ruby available (2.1.2-p95 right
now), if you want to use another version add a .ruby-version file to 
your application with the desired version, for example:

    2.1.0-preview2

By default rackup is used to start the application, you can add a
Procfile if you want to customize the server used, example:

    web: puma -t 8:12 -w 2 -p $PORT -e $RACK_ENV
